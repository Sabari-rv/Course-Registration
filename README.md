# Course-Registration

<p>Developed an application (locally) for course registration for Academic year 2022-2023.</p>

<p>Initially, students will be provided with the registration page with Reg. Number, Name and List of courses (
10 Courses) along with its credits(2/3/4). 
<p>Then student validation takes place, that is whether the student has taken minimum credits (16) and not exceeded the maximum credits (26). 
Once the student satisfies the minimum and maximum credits, the application confirms the registration and will update the details in the database. Finally, a registration report will be generated by the application ( Reg.Number, Name, Number of courses, total credits).</p>
<p>This web application has mainly 2 users<ul><li>Student</li><li>Admin</li></ul></p>
